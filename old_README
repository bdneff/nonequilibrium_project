#instructions for each script are contained within each script
#some scripts, like 04_project_traj_onto_modes.sh, require specification in the first few lines for which frequencies want to be analyzed
#here, we just look at the first 1000 modes for the first 5 frequencies, but this can be easily changed

#this will generate data for the equilibrium system

#Prep the system, energy minimization, equilibration
01-prep_equilibrium_MD.sh 

#To prep non-equil system
02-GPU_non_equil_300K.sh

#Run 10ns trajectory
02-GPU_equil_300K.sh

#To run 10ns trajectory for nonequil
02-GPU_non_equil_300K.sh
 


#THE FINAL 4 scripts (03, 04, 05, 06) all have a flag in the first few lines: system_type
#system_type is set to 0 for EQUILIBRIUM
#these scripts will be performed on the run-NPT_equil_300K folder

#system_type is set to 1 for NONEQUILIBRIUM 
#these scripts will be performed on the run-NPT_nonequil_300K folder

#generate average modes from by splitting trajectory into 10 segmments
#then taking average cross-correlation matrix over all 10 segments
#and then diagonalizing the average matrix
03_generate_evals.sh 

#separate the averaging component of the previous script
04_average.sh

#we project velocities from our MD trajectory genearted in 02 onto selected eigenvectors from 03
05_project_traj_onto_modes.sh 

#and then we fourier transform it and compute the VDOS along this one eigenvector/mode/DOF
06_calc_1D_vdos.shi

#the 1D VDOS data output for this protocol will be directed to 
1D_vdos/output/
